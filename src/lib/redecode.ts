 * Re-render one story's card under the CURRENT parser + outlets + format, and report whether that
 * differs from what's live in Slack (via the stored `render_hash`). Pure (no Slack/DB) so it's
 * unit-testable. The headlined mention embeds its original webhook doc (`raw`), so we re-parse that
 * to pick up today's outlet decoding; rendering it with today's `buildAttachment` also picks up
 * format changes (e.g. the "also mentions" fix) that leave the mention fields untouched — which a
 * snapshot-vs-snapshot diff would miss. Comparing to `render_hash` (the card as last sent) is what
 * catches both. Secondary outlets carry no raw, so only the headline is re-decoded (they still render
 * in the "Also in:" line). A NULL `render_hash` (row posted before the column existed) counts as
 * changed, so the first backfill refreshes it.
